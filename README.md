Nowadays, software solutions are not just confined to one single app. We have growing number of solutions that interact with multiple apps to provide one solution. Testing plays a major role before users get the taste of the product. The developers need quick feedback to get the product ready to go. For that UI Automation also plays a role.

Running UI tests in CI can be challenging as running Emulators on cloud compute require endless configurations and then tests take too much to execute specially when we want to run two apps concurrently. For this use case, GenyMotion gives an option to run concurrent virtual devices on its cloud. This repo contains a workflow that runs maven tests on GenyMotion cloud virtual devices.
